# Code Review Walkthrough

This code review provides a walkthrough of my original project work prior to enhancement. I explain how the existing code functions, highlight areas for improvement, and outline the changes I planned across design, efficiency, and security. The review reflects how I applied course outcomes to guide my thinking and showcases my approach to writing clearer, more maintainable code. It sets the foundation for the enhancements documented in the sections that follow.
