# Professional Self-Assessment

Welcome to my professional ePortfolio for the Southern New Hampshire University Computer Science program. This landing page will eventually house a polished self-assessment that introduces my specialization, highlights the strengths I cultivated throughout the program, and connects visitors to the enhanced artifacts showcased below. For now, the structure is in place so that I can quickly replace the placeholder copy with my final narrative.

## How to Use This Portfolio

- Start with the **Professional Self-Assessment** once it is completed. It will summarize my technical journey, connect program outcomes to real projects, and outline my career goals.
- Review each artifact enhancement under the **Artifacts** section. Every page contains space to describe the original work, the enhancements I implemented, and the skills or outcomes demonstrated.
- Watch the **Code Review** walkthrough for context on the enhancement plan, design rationale, and how the artifacts satisfy the capstone requirements.

> **Update Reminder:** Replace this text with a refined self-assessment that discusses collaboration, stakeholder communication, data structures and algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security. Ensure it introduces the artifacts and provides quantifiable evidence of growth once enhancements are complete.
