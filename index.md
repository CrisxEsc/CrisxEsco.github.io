## How to Use This Portfolio

- Start with the **Professional Self-Assessment**. It will summarize my technical journey, connect program outcomes to real projects, and outline my career goals.
- Review each artifact enhancement under the **Artifacts** section. Every page contains space to describe the original work, the enhancements I implemented, and the skills or outcomes demonstrated.
- Watch the **Code Review** walkthrough for context on the enhancement plan, design rationale, and how the artifacts satisfy the capstone requirements.

# Professional Self-Assessment

**Introduction**

Completing the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science has been both demanding and rewarding. My concentration in software engineering has shaped my approach to building applications that are not only functional but also grounded in user needs and sound technical principles. As I move toward data scientist roles, this portfolio captures the growth I have experienced throughout the program. The projects included show the depth of my technical skills and the direction of my professional goals. This assessment introduces that work and provides a narrative that connects my experiences to the broader goals of the field.

**Key Competencies and Skills Developed**

Team collaboration has been a consistent part of my learning. In one course, I helped build a playlist manager with a small group. We used Git for version control and followed Agile practices. This helped me understand how to divide work efficiently and how to merge ideas into a shared product. These skills grew further during my capstone as I planned and implemented each enhancement independently, while keeping an eye on what would be understandable and usable by others.

Communicating with stakeholders has been another important area. I wrote several design documents and requirement specifications during the program. Each one had to be clear to non-technical readers while remaining accurate. When presenting my animal shelter dashboard, I focused on using visual aids to explain trends and user activity. This helped me practice translating technical data into actionable insight.

My understanding of data structures and algorithms improved through coursework and direct application. I developed recursive search tools, worked with binary trees, and applied sorting algorithms. This knowledge helped me improve the efficiency of my event tracking application. For example, I used lists and hash maps to speed up the way events are stored and retrieved.

Software engineering and database design are central to my work. I built and enhanced full-stack applications that use structured and unstructured data. My event tracking application relies on well-designed classes and follows object-oriented principles. For the dashboard, I worked with a MongoDB backend and used Python to process and display data clearly. These projects show my ability to combine clean design with reliable data handling.

Security practices were emphasized in several assignments. I learned about common threats such as SQL injection and implemented ways to defend against them. In my enhanced projects, I added user authentication, encrypted passwords, and removed any hard-coded sensitive information. I also added input validation to both applications to help prevent improper data usage.

**Portfolio Artifacts and Integration**

The first artifact is my event tracking application. This project began as a basic tool to log events but became a robust and secure application through several stages of development. I added multiple event categories, redesigned the interface, and strengthened the security model. The final version shows my ability to work across the full stack and build something reliable and user focused. It highlights both my engineering and problem-solving abilities.

The second artifact is the animal shelter dashboard. This project shows my skill in turning raw data into something meaningful. The dashboard uses real data, stored in a NoSQL database, and presents it using a clean interface. I refined the design to support new visualizations, including charts showing adoption trends. This work demonstrates my focus on usability, data literacy, and practical insights.

Together, these artifacts form a clear picture of my abilities. The event tracker focuses on engineering while the dashboard emphasizes data and presentation. Both projects required thoughtful design, testing, and user awareness. They also represent the kind of work I want to continue doing. I enjoy building tools that solve problems, present information clearly, and are grounded in sound technical decisions.

**Professional Outlook**

This program has helped me find a clear professional path. I entered it with general interest and finished with a set of defined goals. I now aim to grow in the field of data science where I can use both my technical and analytical skills. The ability to process data, recognize patterns, and create meaningful visuals is something I enjoy and value. The dashboard project especially helped me realize that. I see myself as a person who values accuracy, clarity, and growth. Each course and project has reinforced those values. The capstone taught me how to plan ahead, organize code, and return to earlier work with a critical eye. I know that the field will continue to change, and I feel ready to change with it. I also believe that clear communication, steady learning, and technical care are the tools that will support any successful career.

*To those reviewing my portfolio, I hope it shows not just what I know but how I think. These projects were chosen and improved with care. They represent both where I have been and where I want to go. I am excited to take the next step and apply my skills in ways that are both practical and meaningful.*
