# Artifact Enhancements

This section acts as a roadmap for showcasing growth in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Each enhancement page below follows the same structure so that peers, instructors, and employers can quickly review the original work, the modifications made, and the skills demonstrated.

## Enhancement Categories

- [Software Design & Engineering](artifacts/software-design-engineering.html)
- [Algorithms & Data Structures](artifacts/algorithms-data-structures.html)
- [Databases](artifacts/databases.html)

### How to Update These Pages

1. Upload your original project files and any enhanced source code to an accessible repository or subdirectory.
2. Replace the placeholder text on each enhancement page with detailed narratives.
3. Embed or link to live demos, repositories, and supporting documentation as needed.
4. Summarize how the enhancement demonstrates mastery of course outcomes.

> **Tip:** Each artifact page includes callouts for the original artifact, the enhancement work, and reflections. Fill in these sections once the enhancements are complete.
