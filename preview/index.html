      <p>Welcome to my professional ePortfolio for the Southern New Hampshire University Computer Science program. This landing page will eventually house a polished self-assessment that introduces my specialization, highlights the strengths I cultivated throughout the program, and connects visitors to the enhanced artifacts showcased below. For now, the structure is in place so that I can quickly replace the placeholder copy with my final narrative.</p>

      <h2 id="how-to-use">How to Use This Portfolio</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with the <strong>Professional Self-Assessment</strong> once it is completed. It will summarize my technical journey, connect program outcomes to real projects, and outline my career goals.</li>
        <li>Review each artifact enhancement under the <strong>Artifacts</strong> section. Every page contains space to describe the original work, the enhancements I implemented, and the skills or outcomes demonstrated.</li>
        <li>Watch the <strong>Code Review</strong> walkthrough for context on the enhancement plan, design rationale, and how the artifacts satisfy the capstone requirements.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>Update Reminder:</strong> Replace this text with a refined self-assessment that discusses collaboration, stakeholder communication, data structures and algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security. Ensure it introduces the artifacts and provides quantifiable evidence of growth once enhancements are complete.
