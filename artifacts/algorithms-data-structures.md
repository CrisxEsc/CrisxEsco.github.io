# Algorithms & Data Structures Enhancement

Document how you optimized algorithms, data structures, or overall efficiency in this artifact.

## Artifact Overview

- **Artifact Title:** _Add the project or repository name_
- **Course / Context:** _Identify when and where the project originated_
- **Technology Stack:** _List languages, frameworks, and tools_

## Baseline Performance or Behavior

> _Summarize how the original implementation worked and any performance metrics, limitations, or complexity concerns you identified._

## Enhancement Strategy

Explain the algorithmic improvements or data structure changes you implemented. Examples include:

- Replacing inefficient algorithms with optimized variants
- Introducing appropriate data structures to reduce complexity
- Parallelizing or batching operations to improve throughput
- Adding instrumentation or profiling to validate performance gains

## Results & Evidence

| Metric | Before | After | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Time Complexity | _e.g., O(n^2)_ | _e.g., O(n log n)_ | _Explain the change_ |
| Space Complexity | _Describe baseline_ | _Describe improvement_ | _Add references to code_ |
| Performance Benchmark | _Add numeric baseline_ | _Add improved result_ | _Link to benchmark script or output_ |

## Reflection

- **How did the enhancement improve the artifact's efficiency or scalability?**
- **What tools, analyses, or tests did you use to verify the improvement?**
- **Which course outcomes does this enhancement satisfy?**

> **Next Step:** Replace each placeholder with concrete data, code snippets, and supporting visuals after completing the enhancement.
